Since we make use of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Bitters](http://neat.bourbon.io/) you have to install them via bower  
Just run the following commmand in the root directory:

  bower instal

You also need the [Sass Gem](http://sass-lang.com/install) to compile the Sass files into CSS:

  gem install sass
